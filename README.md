<h1 align=center>Libft</h1>

<p align=center>Libft is the first 42 school's project in which it is expected to code standard functions of C programming language.
  It's all about coding them from scratch and creating a library that will serve as the basis for future projects.

<h3 align="left">What I've learned 📚</h3>

I've acquired a lot of basic knowledge on C programming :
- Makefile and compilation
- Linked lists
- Pointers
- Memory handling

<h3 align="left">If I had to do it all over again 🗒</h3>

- I would maximize function reuse whenever possible
- I would recode ft_split.c differently (this one was a challenge for me!)
- In some functions, would save some code lines to make the code lighter
